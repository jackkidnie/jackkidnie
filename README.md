## Hi, I'm Jack.

I'm an undergraduate junior in EE + CE and student researcher at the University of Missouri - Columbia.

### Primary Work

My main research focuses on

1. Creating reduced-order neuron workflows for dendritic spike studies
2. Modeling brain microcircuits to investigate brainwave origins and memory formation
3. Making novel K-12 STEM lesson plans and products to be hosted on TeachEngineering.org

My primary research project, reduced order neuron pipeline, is not publicly avaiable at this time.
